Multiply by servings you actually eat.</p><h3>Macronutrients to Watch</h3><ul><li><strong>Total Fat:</strong> Look at the breakdown—unsaturated is good, saturated should be limited</li><li><strong>Trans Fat:</strong> Should be 0g. Any amount is harmful</li><li><strong>Sodium:</strong> Keep under 2300mg/day total. Single items shouldn't exceed 600mg</li><li><strong>Total Carbs:</strong> Check fiber and sugar breakdown</li><li><strong>Fiber:</strong> Higher is better. Aim for 25-35g daily</li><li><strong>Sugars:</strong> Look for "Added Sugars" line—this is the enemy</li><li><strong>Protein:</strong> More is usually better for satiety</li></ul><h2>The Ingredients List</h2><p>Ingredients are listed by weight, highest to lowest.

Look for "100% Whole Grain" or check ingredients.</p><h3>"No Added Sugar"</h3><p>May still be high in natural sugars (fruit juice) or artificial sweeteners.</p><h3>"Organic"</h3><p>Better for pesticide avoidance, but organic cookies are still cookies.</p><h2>Quick Label Reading Rules</h2><ol><li>5 or fewer ingredients = generally better</li><li>Can you pronounce all ingredients?</li><li>Is the first ingredient a whole food?</li><li>Added sugar under 5g per serving</li><li>Fiber at least 3g per serving</li><li>Sodium under 400mg per serving</li></ol>`,

    content: `<h2>What is Macro Counting?</h2><p>Instead of just counting calories, macro counting tracks your intake of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. This approach ensures you're getting the right types of calories, not just the right amount.</p><h2>Why Count Macros?</h2><ul><li>Build muscle more effectively (adequate protein)</li><li>Have more energy (proper carb intake)</li><li>Feel more satisfied (sufficient healthy fats)</li><li>Flexibility to eat foods you enjoy</li><li>Learn about food composition</li></ul><h2>Step 1: Calculate Your Targets</h2><p>Start with your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), then split into macros:</p><h3>For Fat Loss</h3><ul><li>Protein: 2g per kg body weight</li><li>Fat: 25% of calories</li><li>Carbs: Remaining calories</li></ul><h3>For Muscle Gain</h3><ul><li>Protein: 1.8g per kg body weight</li><li>Fat: 25-30% of calories</li><li>Carbs: Remaining calories (higher!)</li></ul><h3>Example: 70kg person, 2000 cal fat loss</h3><ul><li>Protein: 140g (560 cal)</li><li>Fat: 55g (500 cal)</li><li>Carbs: 235g (940 cal)</li></ul><h2>Step 2: Track (But Don't Obsess)</h2><h3>Recommended Apps</h3><ul><li>MyFitnessPal (huge database)</li><li>Cronometer (most accurate)</li><li>HealthifyMe (Indian foods)</li></ul><h3>Tracking Tips</h3><ul><li>Weigh food raw when possible</li><li>Log before you eat, not after</li><li>Be honest—every bite counts</li><li>Use measuring cups for liquids</li></ul><h2>Step 3: The 80/20 Approach</h2><p>Track 80% accurately, allow 20% flexibility. This prevents burnout and maintains sanity.</p><h3>What to Track Strictly</h3><ul><li>Main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)</li><li>Cooking oils and fats</li><li>Caloric beverages</li><li>Snacks over 100 calories</li></ul><h3>What to Estimate</h3><ul><li>Vegetables (except starchy ones)</li><li>Spices and seasonings</li><li>Black coffee/tea</li><li>Small bites while cooking</li></ul><h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><ol><li><strong>Not counting cooking oil:</strong> 1 tbsp = 120 calories!</li><li><strong>Ignoring liquid calories:</strong> Chai with sugar, juices add up</li><li><strong>Eyeballing portions:</strong> You'll underestimate every time</li><li><strong>Only tracking "good" days:</strong> Weekend binges count too</li><li><strong>Obsessing over perfection:</strong> ±10g is fine</li></ol><h2>When to Stop Tracking</h2><p>After 3-6 months of consistent tracking, most people develop "intuitive macro awareness." You can estimate portions accurately and make balanced choices without logging every bite. Use tracking as a learning tool, not a life sentence.</p>`,
